# 4PP-EUSR
Four-pass perceptual super-resolution with enhanced upscaling

## Introduction
This repository contains a TensorFlow-based implementation of 4PP-EUSR, which considers both the quantitative and perceptual quality of the upscaled images.
Our method won the 2nd place for Region 2 in the [PIRM Challenge on Perceptual Super Resolution at ECCV 2018](https://www.pirm2018.org/PIRM-SR.html).

â€» The perceptual index is calculated by "0.5 * ((10 - [Ma](https://sites.google.com/site/chaoma99/sr-metric)) + [NIQE](https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2012.2227726))", which is used in the [PIRM Challenge](https://www.pirm2018.org/PIRM-SR.html).
