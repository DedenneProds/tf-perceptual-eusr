# 4PP-EUSR
Four-pass perceptual super-resolution with enhanced upscaling

## Introduction
This repository contains a TensorFlow-based implementation of 4PP-EUSR, which considers both the quantitative and perceptual quality of the upscaled images.
Our method won the 2nd place for Region 2 in the [PIRM Challenge on Perceptual Super Resolution at ECCV 2018](https://www.pirm2018.org/PIRM-SR.html).
